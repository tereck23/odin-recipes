                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange 
                        juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in 
                        brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper 
                        flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. 
                        Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining 
                        sauce.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned 
                        flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the 
                        hot skillet until browned on both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate 
                        and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high 
                        heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce. 
                        Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
                        until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
